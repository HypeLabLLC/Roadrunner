        <section id="security"><h2 class="trailed">Computer Security</h2><p>Computer security is a growing area of concern in today's world. Hardly a day goes by without hearing about someone affected by a computer virus.</p><p>With over 10 million people in the US expected to be victims of identity theft this year, you need to protect your personal information.</p><h3>How to Protect Against Computer Viruses</h3><p>Preventing infection of your computer is much easier than eliminating one you have already contracted. With so many viruses floating about, it may seem impossible to avoid them. Installing a good Anti-Virus Internet Security package like AVAST 6 Internet Security is a great first step. Although no one product can promise that you will be 100% safe, there are a number of simple precautions you can take to reduce your risk of infection:</p><ol><li>Avoid Unknown Attachments. Nowadays, many viruses are spread via e-mail attachments which, thankfully, can only become active when the attachment is opened or unzipped. While you cannot contract a virus just by receiving e-mail, it is a good idea to delete messages containing attachments if you do not know the sender, or if the subject line includes a tempting phrase like "Here is the file I promised you."</li><li>Avoid Bootleg or Pirated Software. With popular software packages running upwards of $200 and music CDs over $12.00, it can be hard to resist the lure of the bootleg versions freely available on Internet file sharing utilities such as Lime-Wire, WinMx, Bearshare, FreeNet and Gnutella. Virus writers take advantage of the insatiable market for bootlegs to disseminate their creations across the Internet and around the world. It's been reported that more than 70% of bootleg software contains malware.</li><li>Treat Floppy Disks and CDs With Suspicion. Prior to the mid-1990s, most computer viruses were spread via infected floppy disks. While floppy disks aren't inherently evil, as they pass through many hands and many computers, they have an increasingly greater chance of becoming infected by a virus - one that will then infest your system. New technologies such as CD burners (recorders) also open new doors for viruses to slip through. Homemade CD-RW disks (CDs which can be re-written using a burner) with unknown pedigrees can also be a source of infection.</li><li>Back It Up. Along with hardware failure, theft and acts of God or Nature, the possibility of viral infection is just one more reason to back up your data regularly. Perform automatic backups on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You should always keep the last and the next-to-the-last backups in case you need to restore files that have been corrupted. An of-site backup like <a href="http://partners.carbonite.com/roadrunnercomputers">Carbonite</a> is an excellent choice for automatic backup of your important files.</li><li>Purchase Antivirus Software. Most antivirus software packages including <a href="http://send.onenetworkdirect.net/z/133443/CD128454/">AVAST Internet Security</a> offer an automatic background protection mode, which will detect and clean out infections as they appear. If you don't have this option, be sure to use the software to scan any and all Internet downloads, e-mail attachments and foreign disks before you open or run them.</li><li>Check System Requirements. The last thing you need is to trek out, buy the software, trek back, try to install it and get a nasty error message saying "Unable to install program. You need Windows version XYZ." Make sure you check the minimum system requirements and platform on the package before you buy to make sure you get the right version.</li><li>Scan All Drives. Once you've purchased and installed the software, schedule regular scans. Most virus scan programs are set to automatically scan the C: Drive first. It's easy to think you're home free when no viruses are found. Make sure you set the program to check all drives, including e-mail programs, as many viruses are delivered through e-mail attachments and Internet files, and spread through shared documents.</li><li>Update Often. For optimum protection, antivirus software must be updated on a daily or weekly basis so that it can recognize and eradicate new bugs as they make the rounds. The updates can usually be found on the software company's Web site, but if you need reminding, some anti-virus programs like <a href="http://send.onenetworkdirect.net/z/133443/CD128454/">AVAST</a> will automatically install updates. Still, you should never assume that your antiviral software offers complete protection from infection, and you should continue to take basic safe computing precautions.</li></ol><h3><a href="http://send.onenetworkdirect.net/z/133443/CD128454/">Download AVAST Internet Security Here</a></h3>
